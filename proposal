Extreme Pong

## Description
This will be like a normal game of pong but with my own twist to it. There will be a timer that fluctuates due to what blocks you break. These blocks would periodically spawn as well.
There will be two power ups that the speed of the ball and make your ball bigger for a bit.
The idea is that you will want to get a higher and higher score.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Create the simple code of a ball bouncing, with the ball disappearing if it hits the bottom of the screen but still bounce off anything above the bottom edge.
- Feature 2
	- Breakable blocks that will change the timer to increase or decrease due to what blocks get broken.
- Feature N 
	- Two powerups that spawn randomly throughout the map, one will increase the ball speed, the other will make the ball bigger for a time frame

## Challenges
- Simple code on how to make a bouncing ball that will bounce off the edges of the map
- The code to make a moving block that the ball can bounce off from
- Breakable objects by interaction from the ball

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- My ideal outcome is at least a normal pong game with breakable blocks that increase the timer and score, with a movable bar at the end. The first power up should increase the speed of the ball for a bit.
The other powerup should be able to make the bouncing ball increase in size, allowing it to hit more blocks.
I would want the timer to be able to increase and decrease at the right time, and for the score to increase in the right matter. 

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A bouncing ball that can break blocks that it hits. A movable bar that would stop the ball from hitting the bottom and a score that increases each time a block gets hit. A timer that gooes down and once it reaches 0, game ends. 

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Goal 1 - Bouncing ball in a screen
  2. Goal 2 - If the ball hits the bottom edge, it disappears forever, also a movable bar that goes left and right which would stop the ball from hitting the bottom

- Week 2
  1. Goal 1 - Breakable blocks that the ball can break and a timer that goes down
  2. Goal 2 - When the timer ends, game ends, also a score that increases when block breaks

- Week N (Final)
  1. Goal 1 - Different blocks increases or decreases the timer also the first powerup which is size changing
  2. Goal 2 - Last powerup increases the speed of the ball, fix any issues with game
